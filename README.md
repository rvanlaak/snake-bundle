This bundle adds a command to run the snake game in your console.
It is a demo for the `cursor` added in Symfony Console 5.1.
Let it not distract you from your work ;-)

# Installation and Usage
                          
## Installation

When creating a new project first:

    composer create-project symfony/skeleton snake
    cd snake
    
When the project is setup:

    composer require dbu/snake-bundle

## Run

    bin/console game:snake

## Development

Clone the git repository, then run:

    composer install
    ./tests/fixtures/app/bin/console game:snake

# FAQ

## My console is looking weird after running the command

This can happen after aborting the program, e.g. with <ctrl>-c. Reset the console to sane defaults
by typing:

    stty sane

Be aware that input is probably hidden, so you won't see anything until you hit enter.

## Why Snake?

Because it was the first thing I could think of. 
And its simple enough that it should be possible to follow what is going on.
